Assignments from the Foundations of Robotics Course at Cornell University (CS 4750) where the concepts covered and implemented included the fundamentals of ROS, state estimation, planning, and control algorithms.
Robots were visualized in RVIZ.
Car Model: MuSHR (Multi-agent System for non-Holonomic Racing) car
Arm Model: WidowX 250 robot arm (6 DoF)

Assignment Overviews:

HW1:
Implemented ROS node to check for prime numbers.

HW2:
Implemented kinematic model for car and arm from equations of motion derived in written homework.

HW3:
Implemented particle filter with resampling for object tracking with arm and localization with car.

HW4:
Implemented A* and RRT path planning in 2D and SE(2) space for car and arm.

HW5:
Implemented PD and MPC controllers for following reference path, tuning controller parameters for optimal performance.

Final Project:
arm - Autonomously detect and sort items on conveyer belt. Implemented particle filter for object detection and classification, RRT planner for path planning, and PD controller to follow trajectory.
car - Autonomously fetch medicine and call doctor in a hospital environment. Implemented particle filter for AGV localization in hospital environment, A* planner for path planning, and MPC controller to follow trajectory.
